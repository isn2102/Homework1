Setup: load libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

#### Problem 1:

Part A: Create a data frame. (Shortcut for inserting r code chunk is
option+command+i)

``` r
prob1_df <- # Use <- outside of functions and = within functions
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10), 
    samp_greater = samp > 0, 
    char_vec = c("hi", "my", "name", "is", "Isabel", "and", "I", "live", "in", "Harlem"), 
    fac_vec = factor(c("small", "medium", "large", "small", "medium", "large", "small", "medium", "large", "small"))
)
```

Part B: Take the mean of each variable in the data frame.

``` r
# Use pull(df, variable) to pull column from a tibble in tidyverse
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.2507027

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_greater))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)) # Cannot get mean of a character
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, fac_vec)) # Cannot get mean of a factor
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I can get the mean of numbers and logical vectors but not characters or
factors.

Part C: Apply the as.numeric function to the logical, character, factor
variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_greater))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)) 
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, fac_vec))
```

I can convert logical vectors to numeric (0s and 1s for false and true),
and I can also force factors to be numeric (seemingly by the
alphabetical order of the string for each level). The numbers assigned
to each level do not reflect any particular meaning in relation to each
other, which explains why R would not automatically produce a mean since
this would often be meaningless. Characters are not able to be converted
to numeric and show as NA which explains why we cannot get the mean for
the character vector.

Part D: Perform data conversions and operations on variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_greater)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ##  [1] 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.3217556 0.0000000 1.0224047 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ##  [8] 0.0000000 1.9620266 0.8292761

``` r
as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_greater)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_greater)), pull(prob1_df, :
    ## '*' not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_greater))) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ##  [1] -0.22159757 -0.85072386  2.64351117 -0.39625502  2.04480948 -0.79126268
    ##  [7] -0.07053682 -0.29805989  3.92405330  1.65855228

#### Problem 2:

Part A: Load datasets.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Part B: Describe penguin datasets.

The dataset penguins is 344 observations (rows) with information on 8
variables (columns). It contains variables: species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year. The variable species is a factor and contains the options:
Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. The variable island is a factor and contains
the options: Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen. The variable bill\_length\_mm is
numeric. The variable bill\_depth\_mm is numeric. The variable
flipper\_length\_mm is an integer. The variable body\_mass\_g is an
integer. The variable sex is a factor and contains the options: female,
male. The variable year is an integer. The mean flipper length is
200.9152047.

Part C: Make a plot.

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
